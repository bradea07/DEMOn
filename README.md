```bash
cd backend
```

2. **Install Maven dependencies**

```bash
mvn install
```

> **Important Note:** This command will download all required dependencies specified in the pom.xml file and generate the `target` folder. The target folder is excluded from the repository.

3. **Setup MySQL database**

Create a MySQL database named "ecoswap" and configure the connection in `application.properties`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### API Keys

#### Google Maps API

The application uses Google Maps API for maps, directions, and places functionality.

**How to obtain a Google Maps API Key:**
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard"
4. Click "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES"
5. Search for and enable these APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Directions API
   - Geocoding API
6. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
7. Click "CREATE CREDENTIALS" > "API key"
8. Copy your new API key

**Where to add your API key:**

Option 1: Using Environment Variables (Recommended)
1. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory
2. Add your Google Maps API key:

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Option 2: Direct in Code
1. Open `src/components/Map.js`
2. Find the `LoadScript` component (around line 760)
3. Replace the `googleMapsApiKey` value with your API key:

```javascript
<LoadScript
  googleMapsApiKey="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
  libraries={["places", "geometry"]}
>
```

**Securing your API Key:**
- In Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
- Click on your API key and set restrictions:
  - HTTP referrers (websites): Add your domain
  - API restrictions: Restrict to only the APIs you're using

#### Shippo API

The application uses Shippo API for shipping and delivery functionality.

**How to obtain a Shippo API Key:**
1. Go to [goshippo.com](https://goshippo.com) and create a free account
2. After logging in, navigate to "API" section in the dashboard
3. Click on "API Keys" in the left menu
4. Generate a new Test API token (for development) or Live API token (for production)
5. Copy your API key

**Where to add your Shippo API key:**

For frontend:
1. Open `src/components/Delivery.js`
2. Replace the API token in the headers:

```javascript
headers: {
  'Authorization': 'ShippoToken YOUR_SHIPPO_API_KEY_HERE',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

For backend:
1. Open `src/main/java/com/ecoswap/controller/ShippingController.java`
2. Replace the API key value:

```java
private final String SHIPPO_API_KEY = "YOUR_SHIPPO_API_KEY_HERE";
```

**Testing vs. Production:**
- Test API keys (starting with "shippo_test_") are for development only
- Live API keys (starting with "shippo_live_") should be used in production
- Test mode creates test labels that cannot be used for actual shipping

### Database Configuration

Configure the MySQL database connection in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecoswap
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

> **Note**: For security reasons, it's recommended to use environment variables instead of hardcoding your API keys and database credentials.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### Development Mode

1. **Start the backend server**

```bash
# For Windows
cd backend
mvnw spring-boot:run

# For Linux/Mac
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

This will start the Spring Boot application on port 8080.

2. **Start the frontend development server**

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The React application will start on port 3000 and automatically open in your default browser.

### Production Build

To create a production build:

```bash
# Build the backend
cd backend
mvn clean package

# Build the frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The frontend build files will be created in the `frontend/build` directory. You can deploy the Spring Boot JAR file (`backend/target/ecoswap-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`) to serve both the API and frontend files.

### Accessing the Application

## üîí Security Notes

- The Google Maps API key should be restricted to your domain to prevent unauthorized use
- The Shippo API key should be kept secure and not exposed in client-side code
- The application uses browser geolocation which requires user permission
- Personal data from shipping forms is stored in the database and used for email notifications
- Standard security practices for Spring Boot applications should be applied (CSRF protection, secure cookies, etc.)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Map Issues
- **Map Not Loading**: Check that your Google Maps API key is correct and has all required APIs enabled
- **No Recycling Points Found**: Try searching in a more populated area or increase search radius
- **Location Not Working**: Ensure you've granted location permissions in your browser

### Shipping Issues
- **No Shipping Rates Displayed**: Verify your Shippo API key is active and correctly configured
- **Address Validation Errors**: Ensure complete and valid addresses are entered
- **Email Notifications Not Received**: Check spam folder and verify the email service configuration
- **Test Mode Notice**: By default, the application uses Shippo's test API key, so no real shipments are created

### Backend Issues
- **Database Connection Errors**: Check your MySQL connection settings in application.properties
- **API 500 Errors**: Check server logs for detailed exception information
- **Email Service Failures**: Verify SMTP settings and credentials
