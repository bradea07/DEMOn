}
```


## üîí Security Notes

- The Google Maps API key should be restricted to your domain to prevent unauthorized use
- The Shippo API key should be kept secure and not exposed in client-side code
- The application uses browser geolocation which requires user permission
- Personal data from shipping forms is stored in the database and used for email notifications
- Standard security practices for Spring Boot applications should be applied (CSRF protection, secure cookies, etc.)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Map Issues
- **Map Not Loading**: Check that your Google Maps API key is correct and has all required APIs enabled
- **No Recycling Points Found**: Try searching in a more populated area or increase search radius
- **Location Not Working**: Ensure you've granted location permissions in your browser

### Shipping Issues
- **No Shipping Rates Displayed**: Verify your Shippo API key is active and correctly configured
- **Address Validation Errors**: Ensure complete and valid addresses are entered
- **Email Notifications Not Received**: Check spam folder and verify the email service configuration
- **Test Mode Notice**: By default, the application uses Shippo's test API key, so no real shipments are created

### Backend Issues
- **Database Connection Errors**: Check your MySQL connection settings in application.properties
- **API 500 Errors**: Check server logs for detailed exception information
- **Email Service Failures**: Verify SMTP settings and credentials
